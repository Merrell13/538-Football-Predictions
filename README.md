# 538-Football-Predictions

The website fivethrityeight often share the data behind their articles. One feature of the website is their football ratings. The ratings used are SPI (soccer power index).

In 2009 Nate Silver, founder of fivethirtyeight, wrote this about SPI:

The SPI rating is designed to provide the best possible objective representation of a team's current overall skill level. In particular, the SPI ratings are intended to be forward-looking: They measure a team's relative likelihood of victory if a competitive match were to be held tomorrow. This concept may differ somewhat from a retrospective or backward-looking ratings system. The SPI ratings are not trying to reward or punish teams based on their past results; rather, they are trying to predict which teams will have the most success going forward.

As Silver states SPI is forward looking and is used by 538 to judge the probability that teams will win future matches.

The ultimate goal of this project will be to asses the success of SPI in predicting matches but along the way we are also going to use SPI and the the other statistics in the database (xg, nsxg) to find some interesting football nuggets.
